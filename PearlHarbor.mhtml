ighter planes. My heart sank when I read the story. I remember when America=
 didn't have the planes we needed to defend ourselves, and suddenly the ene=
my was at our throats.</span></p><p class=3D"c1"><span class=3D"c0"></span>=
</p><p class=3D"c2"><span class=3D"c0">It was December 7, 1941. &nbsp;I was=
 Officer of the Day at Grenier Field, a new Army Air Corps base near Manche=
ster, N.H. &nbsp;We knew war was imminent. In fact, I'd recently been offer=
ed a well paid &nbsp;-- and strictly unofficial -- job as a pilot for the C=
hinese air force, with a bonus for every Japanese plane I shot down. &nbsp;=
But the fighting in Asia and Europe had done little to prepare the United S=
tates for war.</span></p><p class=3D"c1"><span class=3D"c0"></span></p><p c=
lass=3D"c2"><span class=3D"c0">Most of the planes in my squadron were obsol=
ete. Our B-10 bombers were so out of date only a few of us knew how to fly =
them. &nbsp;When the news from Pearl Harbor reached Grenier Field, we pilot=
s were ready to go. &nbsp;But our planes were not. My .45 sidearm -- borrow=
ed from my brother -- was one of the few working guns on the base.</span></=
p><p class=3D"c1"><span class=3D"c0"></span></p><p class=3D"c2"><span class=
=3D"c0">The guns we did have were packed in Cosmoline. Even if the guns had=
 been ready, our Lockheed Hudson bombers had no gun turrets. Not that it ma=
ttered. We had no ammunition, either. The only bombs on the base were one p=
ound training devices detonated by percussion caps. To make things worse, s=
ome of our planes had been painted with German insignia during war games in=
 Louisiana.</span></p><p class=3D"c1"><span class=3D"c0"></span></p><p clas=
s=3D"c2"><span class=3D"c0">Grenier Field had no mission and no standing or=
ders. &nbsp;We waited for something to happen, but the entire nation seemed=
 stunned. So when I got off duty I took my wife and in-laws into town. I lo=
ved Manchester. The people opened their hearts and homes to the airmen of G=
renier Field, and I'll always be grateful. I remember being at the movies i=
n Manchester when a message flashed on the screen ordering all military per=
sonnel back to base. &nbsp;America began to mobilize at last.</span></p><p =
class=3D"c1"><span class=3D"c0"></span></p><p class=3D"c2"><span class=3D"c=
0">In the days that followed we did what we could, but we couldn't do much.=
 I remember flying down to Westover Field in Massachusetts hoping to find a=
mmunition. There was none to be had. We were on our own. When reports came =
in that a German battle fleet had been sighted in the Atlantic, unarmed pla=
nes from Grenier Field tried to find the enemy's position. Fortunately, the=
 reports were false.</span></p><p class=3D"c1"><span class=3D"c0"></span></=
p><p class=3D"c2"><span class=3D"c0">However, the onslaught that followed w=
as all too real. &nbsp;In the first three months of the war, 121 Allied shi=
ps were sunk along the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. I flew coastal pa=
trols, but German submarine crews were battle hardened and usually a jump a=
head of us. The U-boats had easy pickings, especially at night when convoys=
 were silhouetted against the glow of city lights. &nbsp;It was terrible to=
 see the smoke of burning freighters on the horizon and know that there was=
 virtually nothing we could do about it.</span></p><p class=3D"c1"><span cl=
ass=3D"c0"></span></p><hr style=3D"page-break-before:always;display:none;">=
<p class=3D"c1"><span class=3D"c0"></span></p><p class=3D"c2"><span class=
=3D"c0">Few Americans remember those harrowing days. So heavy were U.S. los=
ses in 1942 that 11 months after Pearl Harbor only one American aircraft ca=
rrier -- the Enterprise -- remained afloat in the Pacific. If the Japanese =
had kept coming, in my opinion they could have landed in California. We had=
 almost nothing to stop them.</span></p><p class=3D"c1"><span class=3D"c0">=
</span></p><p class=3D"c2"><span class=3D"c0">But little by little we armed=
 ourselves. We learned to black out coastal lights. We learned to track and=
 sink submarines. We learned to fight. Nevertheless, America had been caugh=
t off guard. It was our soldiers, sailors, fliers and Marines who paid the =
price.</span></p><p class=3D"c1"><span class=3D"c0"></span></p><p class=3D"=
c2"><span class=3D"c0">That's why I'm concerned that Grumman won't be makin=
g fighter planes any more. From the F4F Wildcat to the F14 Tomcat, Grumman =
built the fighters that kept America free. Will a new generation of America=
ns one day re-learn the lessons of the past? As we recall the sacrifice at =
Pearl Harbor, let's also remember the lesson at Grenier Field. Always be on=
 guard. If we want peace, we must be ready to fight.</span></p><p class=3D"=
