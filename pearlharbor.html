WILLIAM A. WHELTON</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A FEW WEEKS AGO Grumman announced it would no longer manufacture fighter planes. My heart sank when I read the story. I remember when America didn&#39;t have the planes we needed to defend ourselves, and suddenly the enemy was at our throats.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was December 7, 1941. &nbsp;I was Officer of the Day at Grenier Field, a new Army Air Corps base near Manchester, N.H. &nbsp;We knew war was imminent. In fact, I&#39;d recently been offered a well paid &nbsp;-- and strictly unofficial -- job as a pilot for the Chinese air force, with a bonus for every Japanese plane I shot down. &nbsp;But the fighting in Asia and Europe had done little to prepare the United States for war.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Most of the planes in my squadron were obsolete. Our B-10 bombers were so out of date only a few of us knew how to fly them. &nbsp;When the news from Pearl Harbor reached Grenier Field, we pilots were ready to go. &nbsp;But our planes were not. My .45 sidearm -- borrowed from my brother -- was one of the few working guns on the base.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The guns we did have were packed in Cosmoline. Even if the guns had been ready, our Lockheed Hudson bombers had no gun turrets. Not that it mattered. We had no ammunition, either. The only bombs on the base were one pound training devices detonated by percussion caps. To make things worse, some of our planes had been painted with German insignia during war games in Louisiana.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Grenier Field had no mission and no standing orders. &nbsp;We waited for something to happen, but the entire nation seemed stunned. So when I got off duty I took my wife and in-laws into town. I loved Manchester. The people opened their hearts and homes to the airmen of Grenier Field, and I&#39;ll always be grateful. I remember being at the movies in Manchester when a message flashed on the screen ordering all military personnel back to base. &nbsp;America began to mobilize at last.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the days that followed we did what we could, but we couldn&#39;t do much. I remember flying down to Westover Field in Massachusetts hoping to find ammunition. There was none to be had. We were on our own. When reports came in that a German battle fleet had been sighted in the Atlantic, unarmed planes from Grenier Field tried to find the enemy&#39;s position. Fortunately, the reports were false.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, the onslaught that followed was all too real. &nbsp;In the first three months of the war, 121 Allied ships were sunk along the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. I flew coastal patrols, but German submarine crews were battle hardened and usually a jump ahead of us. The U-boats had easy pickings, especially at night when convoys were silhouetted against the glow of city lights. &nbsp;It was terrible to see the smoke of burning freighters on the horizon and know that there was virtually nothing we could do about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Few Americans remember those harrowing days. So heavy were U.S. losses in 1942 that 11 months after Pearl Harbor only one American aircraft carrier -- the Enterprise -- remained afloat in the Pacific. If the Japanese had kept coming, in my opinion they could have landed in California. We had almost nothing to stop them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But little by little we armed ourselves. We learned to black out coastal lights. We learned to track and sink submarines. We learned to fight. Nevertheless, America had been caught off guard. It was our soldiers, sailors, fliers and Marines who paid the price.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why I&#39;m concerned that Grumman won&#39;t be making fighter planes any more. From the F4F Wildcat to the F14 Tomcat, Grumman built the fighters that kept America free. Will a new generation of Americans one day re-learn the lessons of the past? As we recall the sacrifice at Pearl Harbor, let&#39;s also remember the lesson at Grenier Field. Always be on guard. If we want peace, we must be ready to fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Col. William A. Whelton, USAF (ret.), now resides in a nursing home, The Charter House, 1316 Fenwick Lane, Silver Spring, MD 20910. He was a bomber pilot. </span></p></body></html>
